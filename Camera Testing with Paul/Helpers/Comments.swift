/*
 -  We take capture devices, and use them to create capture Inputs
 -  Provide the Session with these inputs
 -  Then save the results un capture Outputs
 
 Setting up the Capture Session:
 
 1. Create a Capture Session
 2. Configuring the nesesary capture devices
 3. Create inputs using the capture devices
 4. Configuring a photo output object to process captured images
 
 When we have the camera device ready, create a layer to display the result on the screen
 
 Capture Session will start running when we have finished the configuration
 
 
 We'll add photo output to the caprture session later, when we want to capture a still image
