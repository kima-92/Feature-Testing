 * You Need some setup in both the BOSS screen and the INTERN screen :
 
    In the BOSS screen:
 
        1. Make the Protocol            -> A list of functions the INTERN needs to have, in order to conform to this protocol
 
        2. No code inside the Protocol  -> these functions will not have code inside, this protocol is just a LIST of functions
 
        3. A Delegate variable          -> This delegate will act as the INTERN, inside the BOSS VC
